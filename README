This plugin allows the user to open a scratch window with some external REPL interpreter (either a shell or some interpreter for any programming language). You should map a key (see the beginning of the file) to the ReplCmd() command which sends the current line to the interpreter (input is in your edited buffer, output is in the scratch buffer).

See video: http://cjoint.com/14ma/DCmkCJGRZH7.htm

The plugin uses FIFO special files and won't work under Windows. On the other hand, it will run either in terminal mode or in graphical mode (no server callback). It doesn't need embbeded script languages like python either.

For working, just type:

  :call ReplNew()
  then :call ReplCmd() on each line to be executed (this should be mapped to some shortcut key)
  :call ReplClose()

Deleting the scratch buffer or the working buffer should close everything also.
